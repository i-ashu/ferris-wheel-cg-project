If the code didn't work then most probably it's a glut library error.
In that case change the header name in the code, "#include<GL/glut.h>" to "#include<glut.h>".
If still it didn't work then try searching for the error in Stackoverflow.com or contact me over LinkedIn or Instagram(in worst case scenario :p)
